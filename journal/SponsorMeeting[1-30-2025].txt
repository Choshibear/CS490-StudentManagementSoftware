Our product for the school management system will be a tool used parents (Primary Users) to see their child’s courses, grades, and records.  Teachers or administrators (Secondary Users) will submit assignments and reports to the system where then the parents will be able to see them.

We will be using the React framework for our project. Begin research on React and how to utilize it into our product. Final product will be hosted on a website, domain will be provided by the sponsor. 

Before our first presentation, research and plan for a design/prototype for our product using the three written requirements below.
