Meeting Notes 3/11 
During this meeting all group members along with our sponsor were present. We discussed if the buttons to choose between parents and faculty in the login page was necessary. The issue brought up was that there is no logic associated with this choice, and it purely serves an aesthetic purpose. The next issue was the gradebook design and how it should be differentiated between parents and teachers. For parents it is not an issue to have all students bunched together but for teachers they will want more sophisticated sorting tools as well as tools to rapidly upload and update grades. The next issue brought up was just how many assignments can a teacher make our sponsor said he would like to make potentially thousands of assignments without fear of crash. The last thing we spoke about was to make sure information is passed clearly and without unnecessary details. The example our sponsor brought up was that in elementary schools many teachers might teach the same class. So if a parent wants to know what time their child has class they donâ€™t need to know everyone who teaches it, or what times all the different sections are.
