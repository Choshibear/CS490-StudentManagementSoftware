1.Navigate to the pages Directory
client/src/pages/

Each file represents a page corresponding to a main system function, defined by its name.

2.Implement UI Components for Each Page
Use the Material UI Library to build React components.
Ensure responsiveness (works on different screen sizes).
Each page should display some initial UI elements relevant to its function.


3.Focus on Layout & UI First
Don't worry about backend connections yet.
Get basic visuals and user interactions working first (buttons, forms, tables, etc.).
If needed, use dummy data to simulate functionality.

4.Next Steps
Once all pages have a responsive UI, we will connect them to the server to handle data and logic.
