How to run client and server.

Enter terminal and enter directory for client
run the line: 
    npm start

client should open automatically in your browser, 
**if you encounter error:['react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.]
run following lines:
    npm install
    npm start


Open/split seperate terminal and enter directory for server
run the line: 
npm run dev

the console should return success message when server is running
you can also see the server by going to localhost:5000
