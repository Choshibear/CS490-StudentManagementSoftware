How to run client and server.

Node.js must be installed onto your machine to run the client/server.
Go into terminal and enter "node -v" to verify if your machine is installed with the latest version of node.js

if you have Node.js installed, skip this step, 
otherwise install node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Afterwards clone the repo from github: https://github.com/Choshibear/CS490-StudentManagementSoftware

Client:
Enter terminal and enter directory for client
run the lines: 
    npm install
    npm start

This will install the dependancies into your local machine,
will automatically open on your preferred browser under localhost:3000.


Server:
Open/split seperate terminal and enter directory for server
    run the line: 
    npm run dev

the console should return success message when server is running
you can also see the server by going to localhost:5000
